# Text Processing and Word Cloud Generation - Conversational AI

This repository contains two projects focused on text processing and visualization using Python. 

## Project 1: Tokenization with NLTK

### Description
This project demonstrates how to tokenize text using the NLTK library in Python. It includes:
- Installation of the NLTK library.
- Tokenization of a sample text into words.
- Counting the number of tokens.
- Generating a frequency distribution of the tokens.

### Requirements
- Python
- NLTK library

### Usage
1. Run the provided Colab notebook for tokenization.
2. Modify the sample text as needed.
3. View the output in the notebook.

## Project 2: Word Cloud Generation

### Description
This project demonstrates how to generate and customize word clouds from text using the WordCloud library in Python. It includes:
- Installation of the WordCloud library.
- Loading text from a file.
- Generating a word cloud with a customizable mask.
- Visualizing the word cloud.

### Requirements
- Python
- WordCloud library
- Matplotlib library

### Usage
1. Upload a text file and (optional) a mask image to your Google Drive.
2. Run the provided Colab notebook for word cloud generation.
3. Customize the parameters as needed and observe the output.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the code files.
2. Open the notebooks in Google Colab.
3. Follow the instructions in each notebook to execute the tasks.
